    The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, was originally a hypertext document management system[1] accessed over the Internet.[2] It has since evolved into the World's dominant software platform.[3]

    The resources of the Web are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), may be accessed by users by a software application called a web browser, and are published by a software application called a web server.
